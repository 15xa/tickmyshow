# TickMyShow 🎟️

**TickMyShow** is a decentralized event ticketing dApp built on **Solana** using the **Anchor** framework.


**Live link: tickmyshow.vercel.app** [Have some SOL airdropped to devnet to use this]
frontend-  **nextjs**

It solves major problems in traditional ticketing systems:

-  Scalping and black-market resale  
-  Counterfeit and duplicate tickets  
-  Trustless, verifiable tickets tied to user wallets  

Each ticket is a **non-transferable NFT**, issued using **SPL Token-2022** — not Metaplex — giving finer control over token behavior and reducing compute unit usage[previous problem with using metaplex].

---

## ✅ Current Features

- Initialize events via Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)  
- Mint **non-transferable NFTs** as tickets using Token-2022  
- Validate ticket ownership + check-in logic on-chain

## 🚨 Project Status:  paused (📚 Exam Season)

> Development is **currently paused** due to ongoing **college exams**.  
> Will resume right after exams finish!

---

## 🔜 Post-Exam Plans

- [ ] Wallet integration (Phantom)  
- [ ] Devnet deployment + testing  
- [ ] Optimize UX and add metadata viewing

> Built with 🦀 Rust, ⚓ Anchor, and ❤️ for real-world Web3 utility.
